"Unlike standard broken link checkers that only scan posts and pages, this plugin goes deeper by analyzing all files, including images, media uploads, and hidden references in widgets, shortcodes, and theme files. It also detects filename inconsistencies, special character issues, and missing auto-generated image sizes, ensuring no broken assets are overlooked.\n"
"\n"
"			Why is this important?\n"
"			Many broken link plugins only detect standard 404 errors in posts and pages, but missing images, incorrectly encoded filenames, and hidden links in widgets or themes can also impact your website. These issues can lead to **poor user experience, slower page load times, and SEO penalties** if search engines repeatedly find broken assets. By going deeper, this plugin helps you **identify and fix hidden problems** that other scanners might miss, ensuring your site remains fully functional and optimized.\n"
"\n"
"			What does the plugin check?\n"
"			â€¢ URL links (internal & external)  \n"
"			â€¢ File links (images, PDFs, CSS, JS)  \n"
"			â€¢ Media library files  \n"
"			â€¢ Theme & widget references  \n"
"			â€¢ Shortcodes & dynamic content\n"
"			â€¢ Encoded & special character filenames\n"
"\n"
"			ðŸš€ This ensures your entire website remains free of broken assets, improving performance, SEO, and user experience."
